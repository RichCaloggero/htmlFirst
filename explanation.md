The purpose of this demo is to show how much easier it is to use built-in HTML elements rather than creating your own equivalence using javascript. Keyboard and screen reader accessibility come for free when pure HTML is used, and due to updated browser capabilities, styling form controls (like `select`, `input`, `textarea`, etc) has gotten much easier. THis last point bares repeating since it is the primary reason developers tend to create their own solutions. However, this is also where we see a lot of inaccessible code, and fixing such code is not necessarily easy nor effective.
